# TrajectoryModeling
A program that calculates the best trajectory for hitting an object based on distance to target.
This was a project I completed in the CSE1223 Intro to Programming in Java course I took at Ohio State University. Utilizing a distance given by the user, this program will find the best angle and velocity hit the target. It will also tell the user how much they missed the target by if they are unsuccessful. I received a 100% on this project.
